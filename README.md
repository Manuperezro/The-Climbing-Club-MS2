    ## Design:

The Desing of the website is made to invite visitors to book and to sell them a different way of Holidays,
So I tried to do a strong and captative design website,  with stronge colors contrast and I include a light / dark mode to ensure that can be confortable to every individual, 
easy to navigate through and stronge and pleasant at the same time. 
I Include some pictures of the destinations to call the atention of the users and  pictures of climbers practicing some indoor and outdoor climbing, with the idea of motivate users to purchase.

### Design Brief:

+ Colour:

The main colours used in the web are: 

- black: Black is a strong color often associated with sophistication, elegance, authority, power, sleekness, stability, strength, formality, and intelligence.

- light grey: considered the colour of architecture, commerce and theory. Some psychologies studies agreed the grey brings; neutrality, wisdom, intelligence, futuristic, resignation, stable, dignity, and compromise.

- Orange :  Orange is often described as an energetic colour. It may call to mind feelings of enthusiasm and excitement. Because orange is a high-energy color, many sports teams use orange in their uniforms, mascots, and branding.

Characteristic that suit perfectly with the needs and goals of the website.

- Links : The colour of the Icons/Links to navigate in the footer are orange with a blue hover with the purpose to made easy to users to identify that they are external links.

+ Typography:

- Font family:'Poppins', sans-serif;

+ Images:

- Imagery was very important to me and I choose images that conveyed the feel of the company throughout. I tried to choose images of attractive and popular landmarks for each retreat destination and also good quality and attractive immages of indoor and outdoor climbing scenarios for the courses section.. 

- Icons
I used line awesome for icons for social media links which I've included in the footer. I've also used blue color hover on the icons to help draw attention to them and to show the user they are clickable. 

- Background image land page : I choose an stronge image with black and orange 2 captatives colors. to end an stronge message to the user.
