    ## Design:

The Desing of the website is made to invite visitors to book and to sell them a different way of Holidays,
So I tried to do a strong and captative design website,  with stronge colors contrast and I include a light / dark mode to ensure that can be confortable to every individual, 
easy to navigate through and stronge and pleasant at the same time. 
I Include some pictures of the destinations to call the atention of the users and  pictures of climbers practicing some indoor and outdoor climbing, with the idea of motivate users to purchase.

### Design Brief:

+ Colour:

The main colours used in the web are: 

- black: Black is a strong color often associated with sophistication, elegance, authority, power, sleekness, stability, strength, formality, and intelligence.

- light grey: considered the colour of architecture, commerce and theory. Some psychologies studies agreed the grey brings; neutrality, wisdom, intelligence, futuristic, resignation, stable, dignity, and compromise.

- Orange :  Orange is often described as an energetic colour. It may call to mind feelings of enthusiasm and excitement. Because orange is a high-energy color, many sports teams use orange in their uniforms, mascots, and branding.

Characteristic that suit perfectly with the needs and goals of the website.

- Links : The colour of the Icons/Links to navigate in the footer are orange with a blue hover with the purpose to made easy to users to identify that they are external links.

+ Typography:

- Font family: Poppins.

+ Images:

- Background image land page : I choose an stronge image with black and orange 2 captatives colors. to end an stronge message to the user.

- retreats images : I choose good quality images of the destinations to made the products more attractive

- courses images : I chose images the practicioners enjoying climbing outdoors and indoors so the users can imagine themselvs having fun while practice
