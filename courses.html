            <h4>WHAT IS LEAD CLIMBING?</h4>
            <p>During lead climbing, the climber ascends a route and periodically clips their rope into an anchor or
              ‘quickdraw’ on the wall.
              Unlike top-roping where the climber can only fall a short distance (approximately 1 metre), a lead climber
              will fall at least twice the distance to
              the most recently clipped quickdraw, making it a more adrenaline-fuelled and high-intensity experience.
            </p>
            <h4>HOW DOES IT WORK?</h4>
            <p> This 7 hour course runs with a maximum ratio of 1:4, ensuring there are plenty of opportunities for you
              to ask the instructor any questions you have and receive personal guidance. You must be able to attend all
              7 hours for the instructor to sign you off to climb alone; when you are signed off you’ll have full use of
              our climbing centre and its huge range of regularly changing lead routes.
              Please be aware that this course is physically demanding and is only suited to those who regularly
              exercise and have a good level of fitness.
              It’s largely suited to those who are competent boulderers, however, this course doesn’t require any prior
              climbing knowledge or experience.</p>
            <h4>KEEPING YOU SAFE</h4>
            <p> All of our courses are subject to strict new hygiene and safety protocols, which have been developed by
              The #
              Association of British Climbing Walls. Your safety and the safety of our staff is paramount. We are
              looking forward to seeing you back in the centre.</p>
